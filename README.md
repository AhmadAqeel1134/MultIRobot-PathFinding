# MultiRobot Path Finding 
This project implements a multi-robot pathfinding algorithm on a grid using heap queues (heapq). It efficiently computes collision-free paths for multiple robots navigating the grid.
# Usage
The program requires three text files, 1.) a data.txt file that will represent the grid. 2.) a robots.txt that will have number of robots and start and end goal of each robot. 3.) a agent.txt that shows movement of dynamic agents inside the grid.
After receiving required files, algorithm will return the collision free path for each robot to reach the end state i.e.goal.
